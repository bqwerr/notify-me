# Notify Abroad

a simple app that lets you forward your text messages and/or call logs to your telegram chat.


## But why ?
When I was flying to the US for my masters, it was an unavoidable need to have access to the OTPs or calls that come to my Indian number, which by the way I left back at home. Since it was **not** feasible to contact a human in India who can relay the OTPs everytime it is received by the Indian number, I built this app so that it is forwarded automatically to my telegram chat.
