</div>

## How to use?

- I am assuming you already have a Telegram account by now. If not, create one before proceeding to the next step.
- Create a Telegram bot with the help of [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather).
- Note down the token associated with the bot.
- And press the **START** button in the bot's chat.
  - This is important! Otherwise, the bot can't send you any message.
- Note down your own Telegram user ID with the help of a bot like [this](https://t.me/chatid_echo_bot) one.
- Enter both the values into the fields in the app and save the settings.
- Hola! All your messages/calls will be forwarded to your Telegram chat.
- Ensure that the device, this app is installed on, is charged and connected to the internet all the time.

## But why ?
When I came to the US for my master's, it was an unavoidable need to have access to the OTPs or calls that come to my Indian number, which, by the way, I left at home. Since it was **not** feasible to contact a human in India, who can relay the OTPs, everytime it is received by the Indian number, I built this app to forward 'em automatically to my telegram chat.
